# 📄 Resume Category Prediction

## 📌 Overview
The **Resume Category Prediction** app is a machine learning-based **Streamlit** application that predicts the job category of a given resume. It allows users to upload resumes in **PDF, DOCX, or TXT** formats, extracts the text, processes it, and classifies it using a **pre-trained Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model**.

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 **Resume Upload** – Supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats.
- 🔍 **Text Extraction** – Extracts text from resumes while handling errors.
- 📝 **Text Cleaning** – Cleans resume text by removing unnecessary symbols, links, and special characters.
- 🤖 **Category Prediction** – Uses a trained ML model to classify resumes into relevant job categories.
- 🎨 **Interactive UI** – Built using Streamlit for an easy-to-use experience.
